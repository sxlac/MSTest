## Services

- [A1C Process Manager](https://cvs-hcd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AncillarySvcs/pages/51217058/A1C+Process+Manager) **(deprecated)** -
  Processes events corresponding to the *mail-in* A1C (aka HbA1C) hemoglobin blood test which measures
  average blood glucose (blood sugar) level over the past 3 months, to test for type 2 diabetes and
  pre-diabetes.
- [CKD Process Manager](https://cvs-hcd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AncillarySvcs/pages/51217733/CKD+Process+Manager) **(deprecated)** -
  Processes events corresponding to the Chronic Kidney Disease test.
- [DEE Process Manager](https://cvs-hcd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AncillarySvcs/pages/51219587/DEE+Process+Manager) -
  Processes events corresponding to the Diabetic Eye Exam. The Diabetic Eye Exam is done via a portable
  device which captures eye images, which are sent to trained ophthalmologists to identify conditions
  such as diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, vascular occlusions and hypertensive retinopathy
  that can lead to blindness.
- [eGFR Process Manager](https://cvs-hcd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AncillarySvcs/pages/51222080/eGFR+Process+Manager) -
  Processes events corresponding to the eGFR test. This is an in-home blood test which is mailed ot a
  lab to determine the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which is a measure of your level of
  kidney function and is used to screen for kidney disease and urinary tract disorders in members with
  diabetes.
- [FOBT Process Manager](https://cvs-hcd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AncillarySvcs/pages/51218007/FOBT+Process+Manager) -
  Processes events corresponding to the mail-in Fecal Occult Blood Test.
- [HbA1C POC Process Manager](https://cvs-hcd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AncillarySvcs/pages/51216991/HBA1CPOC+Process+Manager) -
  Processes events corresponding to the HbA1C Point-of-Care (*non-mail-in*, which provides real-time
  results) blood test.
- [PAD Process Manager](https://cvs-hcd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AncillarySvcs/pages/51218199/PAD+Process+Manager) -
  Processes events corresponding to the Pulmonary Arterial Disease test. This test uses a portable
  device that provides immediate results, to help identify members at higher risk of myocardial
  infarction (MI) or stroke.
- [Spirometry Process Manager](https://cvs-hcd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AncillarySvcs/pages/51218696/Spirometry+Process+Manager) -
  Processes events corresponding to the Spirometry exam. Spirometry is used to diagnose asthma, chronic
  obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other conditions that affect breathing. Spirometry may also
  be used periodically to monitor your lung condition and check whether a treatment for a chronic lung
  condition is helping you breathe better.
- [uACR Process Manager](https://cvs-hcd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AncillarySvcs/pages/51236767/uACR+Process+Manager) -
  Processes events corresponding to the uACR test. When testing for chronic kidney disease, the urine
  Albumin-Creatinine Ratio (uACR) is examined to determine if the kidney is functioning normally.
